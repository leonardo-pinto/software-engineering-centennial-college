        <p>
          I'm a Medical Physicist with a Biotechnology PhD degree fascinated
          about discovering new things. This passion about science and
          understanding how things work led me to the world of technology and
          web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, in 2021 I decided to start my career transition from the
          academic to the tech area by taking a Web Development course, and at
          the end of the year I got my first job in the area. During my 1-year
          experience working as a Full-stack Software Engineer, I was able to
          enhance both my technical and soft skills, while improving my passion
          for technology and its impact on the world.
        </p>

          The year of 2023 represents a milestone in my life. I have fulfilled
          one of my biggest dreams - live in Canada - and I have started a new
          challenge - a Software Engineer Technician course at Centennial
          College. From this point, my goal is to continue increasing my
          technical skills and to continue my Software Engineer career, now in
          Canada.
